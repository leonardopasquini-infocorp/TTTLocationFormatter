# TTTLocationFormatter
## Format coordinates, distance, bearing, and velocity in Metric or Imperial Units

When working with `CoreLocation`, you can use your favorite unit for distance... so long as your favorite unit is the meter. If you want to take distance calculations and display them to the user, you may want to use kilometers instead, or maybe even miles, if you're of the [Imperial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) persuasion.

`TTTLocationFormatter` gives you a lot of flexibility in the display of coordinates, distances, direction, speed, and velocity. Choose Metric or Imperial, cardinal directions, abbreviations, or degrees, and configure everything else (number of significant digits, etc.), with the associated `NSNumberFormatter`.

## Example Usage

    TTTLocationFormatter *locationFormatter = [[[TTTLocationFormatter alloc] init] autorelease];
    CLLocation *austin = [[[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:30.2669444 longitude:-97.7427778] autorelease];
    CLLocation *pittsburgh = [[[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:40.4405556 longitude:-79.9961111] autorelease];
    
### Distance in Metric Units with Cardinal Directions

    NSLog(@"%@", [locationFormatter stringFromDistanceAndBearingFromLocation:pittsburgh toLocation:austin]);
    // "2,000 km Southwest"
    
### Distance in Imperial Units with Cardinal Direction Abbreviations

    [locationFormatter.numberFormatter setMaximumSignificantDigits:4];
    [locationFormatter setBearingStyle:TTTBearingAbbreviationWordStyle];
    [locationFormatter setUnitSystem:TTTImperialSystem];
    NSLog(@"%@", [locationFormatter stringFromDistanceAndBearingFromLocation:pittsburgh toLocation:austin]);
    // "1,218 miles SW"
    
### Speed in Imperial Units with Bearing in Degrees

    [locationFormatter setBearingStyle:TTTBearingNumericStyle];
    NSLog(@"%@ at %@", [locationFormatter stringFromSpeed:25],[locationFormatter stringFromBearingFromLocation:pittsburgh toLocation:austin]);
    // "25 mph at 310Â°"

### Coordinates

    [locationFormatter setUsesSignificantDigits:NO];
    NSLog(@"%@", [locationFormatter stringFromLocation:austin]);
    // (30.2669444, -97.7427778)
